# WebP Crawler

WebP Crawler is a Python-based GUI application designed to convert all images within a specified directory _**and its subdirectories**_ to WebP (or PNG) format while maintaining the original folder structure.

## Features

- **Bulk Image Conversion**: Efficiently converts a large number of images.
- **Format Flexibility**: Supports conversion to both webp and png formats.
- **Folder Structure Preservation**: Retains the original folder tree during conversion.

## Ideal Users

This tool is perfect for those who have a collection of images sorted into folders and are looking to save disk space without compromising on image quality.

## Single Folder Conversion

If you only need to convert one folder, you can do that too! Just ensure that it does not contain any subdirectories.
