# WebP Crawler
Python script with GUI to convert all images within a directory and its subdirectories to webp/png format while retaining their original folder tree.

## Who is this for?
If you have a bunch of images that are sorted into folders, this script can save quite a lot of disk space for you while retaining image quality.

### What if I only need to convert one folder?
You can do that - just make sure it has no subdirectories inside of it.
